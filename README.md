## Unit Structure

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

2 Hours of In-Class Time, consisting of:

- Interactive Lesson. An instructor-led discussion of this unit's topics, assignments, and how they relate to real-world Android App Development.
  Estimated time: 30-60 minutes (synchronous)
- Labs. In each class session, students will follow guides to learn new concepts through hands-on programming, collaboratively building apps.
  Estimated time: 60-90 minutes (synchronous)

Unit Projects:

- For units 1-7, a mobile app specification is assigned to each student as an individual project. This is the student's chance to demonstrate what they have learned that unit!
- For units 8-10, students will be divided into teams of 3-4 students to scope, design, and build a larger project applying everything they've learned in the course. Groups will showcase their apps on demo day in the final unit.
